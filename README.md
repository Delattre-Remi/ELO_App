Simple application made for a friend.
HTML Page used to calculate ELO between players.

Enter every player then input every matches played, and the app calculates ELO and Ranking automatically.
Everything is stored locally so the app can run server-less. The page includes JSON exporting and importing to be able to save and get back to a session later.

The app is available on [Github.io](https://delattre-remi.github.io/ELO_App/)
